# (MEDIUM) Lack of slippage protection in `sellVotes` function of `ReputationMarket.sol` could lead to undesired outcomes for vote sellers

## Summary
The [`sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) function in the [`ReputationMarket.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol) contract lacks slippage protection, which could result in users receiving fewer funds than anticipated when selling votes. While the [`buyVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) function implements a slippage protection mechanism to safeguard users, this protection is absent in [`sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534). Consequently, vote sellers may face undesirable outcomes.

## Root Cause
No slippage protection in the [`sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) function.

## Attack Path
Consider that Alice wants to sell some of her TRUST votes, and Bob wants to buy some DISTRUST votes:

1. Bob's transaction is executed first.
2. The price of DISTRUST votes increases, and the price of TRUST votes decreases.
3. Alice's transaction is executed afterward.
4. Alice sells her TRUST votes at a lower rate and receives fewer funds.
5. If Alice had slippage protection, she could safeguard herself from selling her votes at a lower rate and receiving fewer funds than desired.

## Impact
The absence of a slippage protection mechanism in the [`sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) function could lead to users receiving fewer funds than expected when selling votes.

## Mitigation
Consider adding slippage protection in the [`sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) function, similar to the [`buyVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) function, so users can protect themselves against undesired outcomes when selling votes.
